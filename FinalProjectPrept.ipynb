        "## 1.1 Project Overview\n",
        "The goal of this project is to develop a binary classifier that predicts whether a flight will be delayed or not, based on both flight data and relevant weather data. Flight delays impact airlines by increasing operational costs and disrupting passengers' schedules, leading to dissatisfaction. If we can accurately predict delays, airlines can proactively mitigate their effects, improving operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1.2 Business Value\n",
        "- Improved customer satisfaction through proactive delay notifications.\n",
        "- Better resource allocation for airlines.\n",
        "- Reduced operational costs through optimized scheduling.\n",
        "- Enhanced decision-making for both airlines and passengers.\n"
